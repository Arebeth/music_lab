_What's the difference between "active record" and "ActiveRecord"?_
	The active record pattern is an approach to accessing data in a database.
	It is an implementation of the Active Record pattern which itself is a description of an Object Relational Mapping system.

_Is the "active record" pattern an ORM?_
	Yes. Active Record gives us several mechanisms, the most important being the ability to:
	-Represent models and their data.
	-Represent associations between these models.
	-Represent inheritance hierarchies through related models.
	-Validate models before they get persisted to the database.
	-Perform database operations in an object-oriented fashion.

_Why might we want to use an ORM in our code?_
	- It connects the objects to tables in a relational database management system. 
	- It prevents writing SQL statements & reduces code

_What gem do we need to allow Sinatra to interact with ActiveRecord?
	- sinatra-activerecord gem

_What is rake?
	Rake is a standalone Ruby utility, a controller, an internal DSL, programmed in the Ruby language. Rake can help with dependency models, synthesized tasks, custom build routines and debugging the build script. 

_What is a database migration?
	You can think of each migration as being a new 'version' of the database. Migrations are a convenient way to alter your database schema over time in a consistent and easy way. 

_What command can we use to create a new ActiveRecord migration?
	rake db:create_migration NAME=<name>

**_What command runs our existing migrations?
	rake db:migrate

_What commands reverses a migration?
	db:rollback

**_What command tells us which migrations have run and which have not?
	
**_Which class do we have to extend if we want to create a new model?
	subclass the ActiveRecord::Base	class

_What's the difference between ActiveRecord's .new and .create methods?
	.new - object is instantiated, not saved
	.create - object is instantiated AND saved

**_What's the difference between ActiveRecord's .find and .find_by methods?
	.find(*args) - returns all records with matching conditions, otherwise returns RecordNotFound. Usually retrieves a row.
	.find_by(*args) - returns first record matching conditions, otherwise returns nil. 

_What's the difference between ActiveRecord's .find_by and .where methods?
	- find_by - used as a helper to find something within a column, returns 1 item
	- .where - used to find most specific items, use when "find" and "find_by" aren't enough. returns all matching records.

_What ActiveRecord method do we use to change a value in the database?
	user.update(name: 'Dave')

_What ActiveRecord method do we use to remove an item from the database?_
	user.destroy
